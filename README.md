## About

Fold-over Stories is a creative game where players write stories 
one line at a time, with only one previous line being visible to the 
next author. Each turn, a player composes a continuation of the text 
based on the last visible line, resulting in a collaborative story.

## How to launch locally

To launch the project in dev mode, you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose).
After having those, run the following command from inside the project's directory:
```
docker-compose up
```

Once built, the website will be available at
**http://localhost:1234/**.
