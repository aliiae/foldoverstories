## About

Fold-over Stories is a creative game where players write stories 
one line at a time, with only one previous line being visible to the 
next author. Each turn, a player composes a continuation of the text 
based on the last visible line, resulting in a collaborative story.

Play the game at [https://foldoverstories.com](https://foldoverstories.com).
